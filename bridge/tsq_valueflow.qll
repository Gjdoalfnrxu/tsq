/**
 * Bridge library for the value-flow layer (Phase A).
 *
 * Provides a non-recursive `mayResolveTo(valueExpr, sourceExpr)` predicate
 * built from six named branches, unioned at the top level via an
 * `or`-of-calls. Each branch consumes only EDB / extractor-grounded
 * relations — no branch body references `mayResolveTo` itself, so the
 * planner's existing non-recursive sizing path (trivial-IDB pre-pass + P2b
 * sampling estimator) handles cardinality without recursive-IDB work.
 *
 * The `or`-of-named-calls top-level shape is the known-good workaround for
 * disjunction-poisoning bug #166: each branch is its own predicate and the
 * union evaluates as a disjunction of literals each of which is a call to a
 * separate IDB head. That keeps the planner's magic-set rewrite from
 * collapsing the binding-loss case the inline `(A or B)` form triggers.
 *
 * Six branches per docs/design/valueflow-phase-a-plan.md §2:
 *   2.1 mayResolveToBase         — identity on ExprValueSource
 *   2.2 mayResolveToVarInit      — sym whose VarDecl init is a value-source
 *   2.3 mayResolveToAssign       — sym whose Assign rhs is a value-source
 *   2.4 mayResolveToParamBind    — sym is a parameter; arg at call site is value-source
 *   2.5 mayResolveToFieldRead    — FieldRead of a field whose any FieldWrite is value-source
 *   2.6 mayResolveToObjectField  — FieldRead through a VarDecl-bound object literal
 *
 * What Phase A explicitly does NOT cover (plan §6): no recursion, no
 * two-hop var indirection, no spread, no JSX-wrapper unwrap, no call-return
 * composition, no destructure-source, no cross-module, no method/inherit,
 * no type-driven, no effect/Proxy, no await, no `as` cast, no depth bound.
 *
 * The `resolvesToFunctionDirect` derived helper exposes the
 * "callee resolves to a function expression" question the bridge will ask
 * once Phase A PR3 collapses the easy `resolveToObjectExpr*` branches in
 * `tsq_react.qll`. Phase C will replace it with the recursive-aware form.
